      httpOnly: true,  // Blocks JavaScript cookie access (XSS protection)
      // When you use cookies in web apps (like when someone logs in), the browser stores a cookie ‚Äî usually holding a session ID. That session ID is how your app remembers who the user is.
      //setting it true will block JavaScript from accessing the cookie, which helps protect against cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.

      // Say your website has a security hole (a bug) called an XSS attack (Cross-Site Scripting).

      // What is XSS?
      // A hacker manages to inject their own malicious JavaScript into your webpage (maybe through a comment box or form).
      
      // That JavaScript could try to do: "document.cookie"
      // to steal the user's session cookie.
      // If that cookie holds the session ID, the hacker can pretend to be that user and access their account.
      
      //by setting it to true the cookie is invisble.
      


      sameSite: 'lax'  // Prevents CSRF attacks (use 'strict' for sensitive apps)
      // I open a legit site, and it stores a cookie in the browser. Then I visit a bogus website where the hacker has written invisible code that triggers the browser to send a request to the legit site to perform some action. The browser checks the SameSite setting on the cookie and decides whether or not to include the cookie in the request. If SameSite=Strict, the request is still sent ‚Äî but without the cookie, so the action fails.

      //There are 3 option in this: none,strict,lax
      //none: the cookie will be sent in all requests, including cross-site requests.

      //Scenerio: I am already logged in to:myreal website then  see the following result

      // STRICT MODE
      // if i come to website by clicking a link or button so i will be logged out 
      // ‚úÖ Browser does send the request to yourbank.com
      // ‚ùå BUT browser does NOT send the cookie
      // üö´ So the bank doesn‚Äôt know who you are
      // üßä You‚Äôre treated as logged out
      // SameSite=Strict = You must already be on the site for the cookie to work.
      // If you came from another site (even by clicking a link), cookie gets blocked ‚ùå
